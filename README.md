# HR_Portal

At the heart of this project lies the vision of a robust HR Portal, equipped with an
intuitive interface and fortified by Single Sign-on (SSO) capabilities via Active Directory
(AD) authentication. Such an architecture underscores encrypted, secure
communication, leveraging SSL/TLS protocols. Serving as the hub for all HR
interactions, the portal will empower both employees and HR administrators to manage
and view enterprise employee data. Role-based access, powered by SSO, will ensure
restricted and appropriate access levels, emphasizing our unwavering commitment to
data privacy.

### Outlining our roadmap, we've delineated clear milestones:
- **October 10th**: Backend Development Completion, ensuring our system's robust
foundation.

> To initialize the backend, CD into the HR_Portal repo and then run
> docker-compose up -d   

- **October 20th**: Completion of Frontend Development, integrated with the
backend, to guarantee a cohesive user experience.
- **October 30th**: Emphasis on implementing SSO and bolstering security features,
championing data safety.
- **November 10th**: While a full integration with platforms like GitHub and Jenkins
isn't envisaged, the period will focus on codebase synchronization and
management.
- **November 20th**: A crucial phase dedicated to rigorous Testing and Debugging,
ensuring system reliability.
- **November 30th**: User Acceptance Testing, gathering insights into user
experience and system functionality.
- **December 5th**: Commencement of final presentation preparations,
encapsulating our developmental journey.
- **December 10th**: The grand finale - Project Submission and Presentation.
